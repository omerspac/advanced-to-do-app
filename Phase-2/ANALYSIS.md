The `Phase-2` folder is now running.

**Backend:**
- The backend server is running on `http://localhost:8000`.
- I have fixed several issues to get the backend running, including missing dependencies and configuration issues.

**Frontend:**
- The frontend server is running on `http://localhost:3001`.
- I have installed the dependencies and created the `.env.local` file.

You can now access the application at `http://localhost:3001`.
